# MATLAB Traffic Simulation

### Description

This project is the application of my research topic findings for MATH*4600 (_Advanced Research Project in Mathematics_). We aimed to model driver behaviour during sudden braking situations on multi-lane roads.

This MATLAB project accepts starting parameters and uses a series of equations and rules (the established model) in order to generate acceleration, speed, and position at evenly spaced time intervals for a configurable amount of cars. 

The final stages of the project allowed us to specify a vehicle's starting position, speed, and acceleration, in addition to driver reaction time, driver aggression, and "impulsiveness" when considering dangerous driving maneuvers (ex. tight lane changes, sudden deceleration, tailgating). 

Alongside developing a model, I also built a small visualizer to help illustrate vehicle behaviour.
